Abstract:
Constraint programming holds many promises for model driven software development
(MDSD). Up to now, constraints have only started to appear in MDSD modeling
languages, but have not been prop- erly reflected in model transformation. This
paper introduces constraint programming in model transformation, shows how
constraint program- ming integrates with QVT Relations - as a pathway to wide
spread use of our approach - and describes the corresponding model
transformation engine. In particular, the paper will illustrate the use of
constraint pro- gramming for the specification of attribute values in target
models, and provide a qualitative evaluation of the benefit drawn from
constraints integrated with QVT Relations.
